When using git theres a few steps:
1. Pull class files into your local class files repo
2. Copy the files you wanna alter from local class files repo into your own local repo
3. Edit the files
4. git status -> git add --all or git add <file/folder> -> git commit -m "message" -> git push
5. Now file/folders are in your github repo on github itself
